# Creativity in my eyes (A criatividade aos meus olhos)
Project created to respond to the challenge created by the Curricular Unit of Creativity in Multimedia Communication.

The aim of this was that, based on material given in theoretical classes and supported by viewing various videos of testimonials and different studies on creativity, each student should reflect on how they perceive creativity. In this it was possible to reflect on one's professional and/or personal life.

In this sense, I created a Website that appeared in the format of a blog introducing the term creativity and teaching different ways to train it. In addition, I gave practical examples of how this was achieved by my personal experience and also showed creative photographs that were achieved from the techniques described in the blog.
